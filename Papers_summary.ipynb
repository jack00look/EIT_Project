    "\n",
    "The Rb D2 F=1,mF=+-1, F'=1,mF'=0 theoretically provides a very clean $\\Lambda$ system, but the neighboring F'=0 state has opposite Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, so one's system dark state is another's dark state. This is detrimental for coherent effects to build up.\n",
    "They then shifted to Hyperfine EIT and then to D1 line\n",
    "\n",
    "My understanding is that this is the EIA vs EIT competition that you get when multiple hyperfine states play a role, if most neighbor states give EIT you will see EIT, if some give EIA and some EIT it will depend and you will get a small signal, ecc.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, heating up to around 65°C improves greatly the OD for the probe-only regime, but when adding the pump beam, with reasonable intensity, the OD gets very low again, and going to much higher temps is not really an option right now due to melting risk in our components\n"

    "# Alternative Setup (Worth Thesis)\n",

    "Instead of using two beams, we use one linearly polarized beam coaligned with the magnetic field, which will then effectively decompose into a left and right circularly polarized beam along the quantization axis, thus giving a pump-probe setup.\n",

    "\n",

    "1. Use the pump beam with the AOM turned off: open the iris to let the 0th order through\n",

    "3. Set the beam intensity to be in the 0.4- 2.0 mW/cm2 range\n",
    "4. Modulate the magnetic field: ideally, you want a fairly big, modulation, they use +/-20G\n",

    "\n",
    "- select a frequency far away from any resonances: you should not see anything \n",
    "\n",
    "- select the Rb85 Fg=2 F' = 1 line, you should see an EIT feature\n",
    "\n",
    "Some comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- they see that the signal gets worse at higher temperatures (basically disappears at 60°C)\n",
    "\n",
    "- they see that transverse magnetic fields, relative to the beam propagation direction, make the EIT feature broaden and eventually disappears, but 1G transverse field should still display a feature, so in theory, even bad shielding should still display EIT\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant experimental \"parameters\" are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- stray field compensation (they cancel up to 7mG with Helmotz coils, and then improve on that)\n",

    "- polarization purity (use glan-thompson PBS)\n",
